# IPL-Win-Predictor

Situation:
I undertook a project to develop an IPL (Indian Premier League) win probability predictor using machine learning techniques.

Task:
- The goal was to create a web application that allowed users to input match-related data and receive real-time predictions on which team was likely to win an IPL match.
- I aimed to deploy this application on Streamlit, making it accessible to a wide audience of cricket enthusiasts.

Action:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Gathered historical IPL match data, including team performance, venue, and player statistics.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to ensure it was suitable for machine learning.
2. Machine Learning Model Development:
   - Developed a machine learning model using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and pandas.
   - Utilized advanced techniques such as feature engineering, ensemble models, and hyperparameter tuning to improve prediction accuracy.
3. Streamlit Web Application:
   - Created a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input match-specific details.
   - Integrated the machine learning model into the application to provide real-time win probability predictions.
4. Deployment:
   - Deployed the IPL win probability predictor on Streamlit Cloud, making it accessible through a web browser.
   - Ensured the application's scalability and robustness to handle concurrent user requests.

Result:
- The IPL win probability predictor project was successfully completed and deployed.
- Cricket enthusiasts and fans can now use the application to get insights into match outcomes.
- Demonstrated proficiency in machine learning, web application deployment, enhancing my skills and portfolio for future opportunities.
